## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwind.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

NOTE: getStaticProps(); normally in React, initial data is not fetched until the next render cycle (client-side data fetching after a page is fully rendered), therefore, the initial page will load with no data until the next render cycle, which is not good for SEO. However, with getStaticProps(), the data will initially render during the build phase, so that when the initial page is rendered, the data will also be rendered too. Hence, eliminating the need of using useEffect() in the component.

```css

```js
